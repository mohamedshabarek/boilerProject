# How to use git tutorial



**Pull** -  you are grabbing the code from a certain branch and inserting it to the branch you are currently on.

**Branch** - A branch is essentially different versions of the project. The best way is to make each branch a feature or a task. You are branching out from the original code base.

**Merge** - You are essentially taking the contents of one branch and putting it together with the contents of another branch.

**Merge Conflict** - A merge conflict is when you're trying to merge two branches that have competing commits and git needs you to decide the final changes to the merge.

**Fetch** - downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repository. Safer than using pull.

**Remote** - A remote is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. It is usually stored on a code hosting service such as GitHub. Different than a local branch because a only the local user can see the local branches.
